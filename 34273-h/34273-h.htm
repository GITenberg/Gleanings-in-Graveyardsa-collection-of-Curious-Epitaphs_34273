<p style="text-align: center">(TO THE FIRST EDITION.)</p>
<p>Although this country may be behind many others in the poetic
or classic character of its monumental inscriptions, it is
certainly not so in the production of Epitaphs of a curious and
absurd character.&nbsp; Whether it is that the British are, as a
nation, witty and humorous, and that they are desirous that their
peculiarities should be recorded even in the sanctuaries of their
dead, or that they consider <i>true</i> records of the departed
to be of little or no value, has yet to be shown.&nbsp; It is,
however, remarkable that if we refer to the epitaphial records of
other nations, we find that they are, as a rule, noted for their
beauty, elegance, or truth, whereas of the many graveyards in
Great Britain there is scarcely one that does not afford examples
of humourous effusions.</p>
<p>The Egyptians, although they do not furnish us with many
epitaphs worthy of note, do not seem to have devoted themselves
to the production of frivolous inscriptions, but contented
themselves with inscribing on their sarcophagi and coffins, the
name, descent, and functions of the departed.</p>
<p>The Greeks (as Mr. Pettigrew remarks in his <i>Chronicles of
the Tombs</i>), &ldquo;wrote their epitaphs in elegiac verse, and
afterwards in prose, and the collections published by various
hands are well known to, and duly appreciated by,
scholars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Roman tombs also afford us an example worthy of imitation,
in the purity and simplicity of their inscriptions.&nbsp; They
usually began with D. M. (Diis Manibus), followed by the name,
office, and age of the deceased, and a conclusion, which informed
the reader by whom or through what means the inscription was
erected.</p>
<p>Whether the Saxons or the Danes used monumental <!-- page
viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>inscriptions, either in their own or in the Latin
tongue, has been doubted.&nbsp; The few which we have for people
of the Saxon times, are probably the compositions of a later
date.&nbsp; Three or four small slabs, however, bearing crosses
and some early British female names, supposed to be those of
nuns, were dug up some years ago at Hartlepool.</p>
<p>We are informed also, by the above quoted author, that
&ldquo;in this country, in early times, were inscriptions
prohibited to be engraven on any tombs but those belonging to
persons distinguished either by their high position, as governors
of the kingdom or as military commanders, or remarkable for their
wisdom and virtues.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since this prohibition has been
removed, however, no time seems to have been lost in showing the
necessity for, and the advantage of, such regulation.</p>
<p>The following pages are intended to convey some idea, to those
who have not the opportunity to search our churchyards for
themselves, of the extent to which the practice has been carried
of inscribing tombstones with verses remarkable either for their
quaintness, or their rude attempts at humour.</p>
<p>It has been thought advisable to intersperse with the curious
Epitaphs a few inscriptions, more elegant in their composition,
and more praiseworthy in their purport.</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous are for the most part authentic, and so
frequently placed on gravestones, that to prevent repetition it
has been thought best to arrange them in a chapter by
themselves.</p>
<p>It is hoped, that while this collection of curious Epitaphs
may afford amusement to all, that it will not prove offensive to
any, nor fail to convey the salutary lesson that a healthful
smile may be elicited from the homely record of human woe.</p>

1</span>EPITAPHS.</h2>
<h3>Bedfordshire.</h3>
<h4>COLMWORTH.</h4>
<p>Here is a magnificent monument, erected in 1611, by Lady Dyer,
in memory of her deceased husband, Sir William Dyer, the
inscription upon which tells us that &ldquo;they multiplied
themselves into seven children.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beneath are the
following quaint lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My dearest dust, could not thy hasty day<br />
Afford thy drowsy patience leave to stay<br />
One hour longer, so that we might either<br />
Have set up, or gone to bed together!<br />
But since thy finished labour hath possessed<br />
Thy weary limbs with early rest,<br />
Enjoy it sweetly, and thy widow bride<br />
Shall soon repose her by thy slumbering side!<br />
Whose business now is to prepare<br />
My nightly dress and call to prayer.<br />
Mine eyes wax heavy, and the days grow old,<br />
The dew falls thick&mdash;my blood grows cold:&mdash;<br />
Draw, draw the closed curtains, and make room,<br />
My dear, my dearest dust, I come, I come.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>EDWORTH.</h4>
<blockquote><p>Here lies father, and mother, and sister, and
I,<br />
We all died within the space of one year,<br />
They be all buried at Whimble except I,<br />
And I be buried here.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>LUTON.</h4>
<p>In the &ldquo;Wenlock Chapel&rdquo; in the above church, on an
embattled altar-tomb is a recumbent figure of a
priest&mdash;representing William Wenlock, who died 1392.&nbsp;
Round the verge of the tomb is inscribed, in ancient
characters,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . .&nbsp; Ilemus hic tumulatus de Wenlock
natus; in ordine presbiteratus; alter hujus ille: dominus meus
fuit ville: hic jacet indignus: anime Deus esto benignus!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the side of the tomb,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>In Wenlock brad I: in this town lordshcippes had
I! here am I now lady: Christes moder help me lady.&nbsp; Under
these stones: for a tym shal I rest my bones; deyn mot I ned
ones.&nbsp; Myghtful God gra&rsquo;t me thy woues.&nbsp;
Ame&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Formerly in a window of this chapel was a portrait of Wenlock,
with the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Jesu Christ, most of might,<br />
Have mercy on John de Wenlock, knight,<br />
And of his wife Elizabeth,<br />
Which out of this world is passed by death,<br />
Which founded this chapel here,<br />
Help thou them with your hearty prayer,<br />
That they may come unto that place,<br />
Where ever is joy and solace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On an altar-tomb in the tower is the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Thomas Gilbert here doth stai<br />
Waiting for God&rsquo;s judgment day,<br />
Who died August 25, 1566.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A slab on the floor of the south aisle bears this
inscription,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Here lyeth the body of Daniel Knight,<br />
Who all my lifetime lived in spite.<br />
<!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Base flatterers sought me to undoe,<br />
And made me sign what was not true.<br />
Reader take care, whene&rsquo;er you venture<br />
To trust a canting false dessenter,<br />
Who died June 11th, in the 61st year of his age,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1756.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A friend of Daniel Knight (at whose instigation the above
epitaph was engraved during his lifetime, and the future
tombstone used as a cupboard door) prepared an inscription for
his own tomb,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies the body of Thomas Proctor<br />
Who lived and died without a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But fate, jealous of the reputation of the faculty, broke his
leg, and compelled him to sacrifice to &AElig;sculapius.</p>
<h3>Berkshire.</h3>
<h4>BUCKLEBURY.</h4>
<p>Here lyeth the body of Samuel Wightwicke, Esqre. 1662.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven only knowes the Blisse
his soul inioyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whil&rsquo;s wee on earth seeke after fading
toyes,<br />
And doe not mind how saints and angells singe<br />
To see him thron&rsquo;d with his eternall king.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>WEST WOODHAY.</h4>
<p>In the old church near Newbury, is the following epitaph to
the memory of Sir Ben Rudyerd:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>John Grant, in memory of his deare and honoured
Master Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, knight, hath affixed this stone over
his grave with this epitaph made by Sir Benjamin in his younger
years:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Fond world, leave off this foolish trick<br />
Of making epitaphs upon the dead;<br />
Rather go write them on the quick,<br />
Whose soules in earthly flesh lye buried.<br />
For in this grave lyes nought of me<br />
But my soules grave, two graves well turned to one.<br />
Thus do I live, from death made free;<br />
Trust me, good friend, I am not dead, but gone<br />
To God and Christ, my Saviour alone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1656.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>OLD WINDSOR.</h4>
<blockquote><p>When this you see remember me<br />
As I lay under ground,<br />
The world say what it will of me,<br />
Speak of me as you have found.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>ALDWORTH.</h4>
<p>There is a vulgar tradition that in this place four Johns were
buried, and they are described as follows:&mdash;John Long, John
Strong, John Ever-afraid, and John Never-afraid.&nbsp; They say
that John Ever-afraid was afraid to be buried either in the
church or out of it, and was consequently buried under the wall,
where the arch appears on the outside, by the south church
door.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following is a copy of an epitaph, now almost obliterated,
in Speen Churchyard, and which, admired for its simple pathos,
has been handed to us for insertion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">In memory of John
Matthews, of Donnington, Berks,<br />
1779.</p>
<p>When Heaven with equal eyes our quick&rsquo;ning dust<br />
Shall view, and judge the bad and praise the just,<br />
His humble merits may perhaps find room<br />
Where kings shall wish, but wish in vain to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>In Sunning Hill Churchyard is the following epitaph on
the late Right Hon. Colonel Richard Fitzpatrick, written by
himself:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Whose turn is next?&nbsp; This monitory stone<br
/>
Replies, vain passenger perhaps thine own;<br />
If idly curious, thou wilt seek to know<br />
Whose relicks mingle with the dust below,<br />
Enough to tell thee, that his destin&rsquo;d span,<br />
On earth he dwelt, and like thyself a man.<br />
Nor distant far th&rsquo; inevitable day<br />
When thou, poor mortal, shalt like him be clay;<br />
Through life he walk&rsquo;d un-emulous of fame,<br />
Nor wish&rsquo;d beyond it to preserve a name.<br />
Content, if friendship, o&rsquo;er his humble bier<br />
Dropt but the heart-felt tribute of a tear;<br />
Though countless ages should unconscious glide,<br />
Nor learn that even he had lived and died.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>NEWBURY.</h4>
<p>On Eliz<sup>th</sup> Daughter of James Bond, 1659.</p>
<blockquote><p>Low, here she is, deprived of lyfe,<br />
Which was a verteous and a loving wife;<br />
Until the graves again restore<br />
Their dead, and Time shall be no more;<br />
She was brought a-bed, but spous above,<br />
And dyed to pay the living pledge of love.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On Mr. Hugh Shepley, sometime Rector of Newbvrye, 1596.</p>
<blockquote><p>Full eight and twenty years he was your pastor,<br
/>
As hee was taught to feede by Christ, his Master;<br />
By preaching God&rsquo;s Word, good life, good example,<br />
(Food for your soules, fitt for God&rsquo;s house or temple)<br
/>
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Hee loved peace, abandoned all strife,<br />
Was kinde to strangers, neighbours, children, wife;<br />
A lambe-like man, borne on an Easter daye,<br />
So liv&rsquo;d, so dide, so liv&rsquo;s again for aye;<br />
As one Spring brought him to this world of sinne,<br />
Another Spring the Heavens received him in.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the Parish Church of Aldermaston is the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To the precious memorie
of four Virtuous Sisters,<br />
daughters of Sir H. Forster, 1623.</p>
<p>Like borne, like new-borne, here like dead they lye,<br />
Four virgin sisters, decked with pietie;<br />
Beavtie and other graces, which commend<br />
And make them all like blessed in their end.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>CHADDLEWORTH.</h4>
<p>To the memory of Mary, wife of Thomas Nelson, of this parish,
who died 1618, beinge of the age of 30 years, and had issue 7
children.</p>
<blockquote><p>If thou religious art that passest by<br />
Stay and reade on; as thou art so was I:<br />
If thou art blest with children, and dost crave<br />
In God&rsquo;s feare them trayned up to have<br />
Reade on agayn, and to thyself thus tell<br />
Here she doth lye that was my parallel;<br />
Or art thou bounteous, hospitable, free,<br />
Belov&rsquo;d of all, and they beloved of thee;<br />
Meeke, full of mercy, and soe truly good<br />
As flesh can be, and spronge of gentle blood?<br />
If thou art soe, to thine own dear selfe saye,<br />
Who on her grave my monument did lay?<br />
But if to these thou knowst thyselfe but chaffe,<br />
Pass on thy waye, reade not my epitaphe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Also Dorothy
Nelson, wife of William Nelson, who died<br />
1619, being of 86 years, and had issue 7 children.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was not many years that made mee good,<br />
Neither was it in the vigor of my blood;<br />
For if soe then my goodness might have past,<br />
And as I did, have ceast to be at laste.<br />
But &rsquo;twas the grace my Maker did enshrine<br />
In my meeke breast, which cleerely there did shine.<br />
As my soul now amongst the chosen blest,<br />
Under this stone although my bones doe rest.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was<br />
Bland, passionate, and deeply religious;<br />
Also she painted in water colours,<br />
And sent several pictures to the Exhibition.<br />
She was first cousin to Lady Jones.<br />
And of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

Religious to God, Loyal to his Prince, true to his Wife, Kind to
his Kindred, Stedfast to his Friend, and Dear to the Poor; that
he was endued with those qualities all his life, and died in the
possession of them.&mdash;As to the Figures, most likely they
were used to distinguish particularly the relation which a word
in one line bore to that, which in another line had the same
figure.</p>

Pindar.</p>
<p>To the Memory of Margaret Southcotte, who died the 27th of
August, 1786, aged 12 years and 9 months.</p>
<blockquote><p>Beneath this stone, in sweet repose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The friend of all, a fair one lies:<br />
Yet hence let Sorrow vent her woes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far hence let Pity pour her sighs;<br />
Tho&rsquo; every hour thy life approv&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The muse the strain of grief forbears;<br />
Nor wishes, tho&rsquo; by all belov&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To call thee to a world of cares.<br />
Best of thy sex, alas! farewell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From this dark scene remov&rsquo;d to shine,<br />
Where purest shades of mortals dwell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And virtue waits to welcome thine.</p>

<p>In the village churchyard, near the Castle, is a rather
singular inscription upon a gravestone, which was put up by the
deceased during his life-time; and when first placed there, had
blanks, for inserting his age and the time of his death.&nbsp;
These blanks have long since been filled up, and the whole now
reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In memory of James Barham, of this parish,
who departed this life Jan. 14, 1818, aged 93 years; and who from
the year 1774, to the year 1804, rung, in Kent and elsewhere, 112
peals, not less than 5,040 changes in each peal, &amp; called
bobs, &amp;c. for most of the peals; &amp; April 7th &amp; 8th,
1761, assisted in ringing 40,320 bob-majors on Leeds-bells, in 27
hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following Epitaph is to be found in the parish church of
Ightham, erected to Mrs. Selby of the Mote House, Ightham, who
was a beautiful worker of Tapestry, whose death is said to have
been caused from her pricking her finger when working one
Sunday.&nbsp; There is a marble figure of her, holding a steel
needle in her hand, and underneath is the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She
was a Dorcas,<br />
Whose Curious needle turned the abused stage<br />
Of this lov&rsquo;d world, into the goldenage,<br />
Whose pen of steele, and silken inck unroll&rsquo;d<br />
The acts of Jonah in records of gold,<br />
Whose art disclosed that Plot, which had it taken,<br />
Rome had tryumphed, and Britains wall had shaken.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She Was<br />
In heart a Lydia, and in tongue a Hanna,<br />
In zeale a Ruth, in wedlock a Susanna,<br />
Prudently simple, providently wary,<br />
To the world a Martha, and to Heaven a Mary.<br />

<p>&ldquo;This Inscription (says a writer in <i>The

letters, on a plate of brass, in the middle aisle, on the floor
near the entrance into the chancel.&nbsp; It contains six lines,
the end of each is marked thus |; and it appears to have been
laid down in the life-time of <i>Robert Midleton</i>, because
neither the year, day, nor month are set down, but spaces left
for that purpose.&nbsp; I observe, that the inhabitants of
Islington want to make their church older than I presume it is,
and quote this inscription as it is in <i>Strype</i>, 1401, in
support of that notion, when it is plain 1500, and is all that it
says; and Sir G. Hastings was not created Earl of

thirty years Cook to the Beef Steak Society.</p>
<blockquote><p>His last <i>steak</i> done; his fire rak&rsquo;d

And <i>dress</i> at Ph&oelig;bus&rsquo; <i>fire</i>, one
<i>scrap</i> for him:&mdash;<br />
His heart which well might grace the noblest grave,<br />
Was grateful, patient, modest, just, and brave;<br />
And ne&rsquo;er did earth&rsquo;s wide maw <i>a morsel</i>
gain<br />
Of <i>kindlier juices</i> or more tender <i>grain</i>;<br />
His tongue, where duteous friendship humbly dwelt,<br />
Charmed all who heard the faithful zeal he felt;<br />
Still to whatever end his <i>chops</i> he mov&rsquo;d,<br />
&rsquo;Twas all <i>well seasoned</i>, <i>relished</i>, and
approv&rsquo;d:<br />
This room his heaven!&mdash;When threatening Fate drew nigh<br />
The closing shade that dimm&rsquo;d his ling&rsquo;ring eye,<br
/>
His last fond hopes, betray&rsquo;d by many a tear,<br />
Were&mdash;That his life&rsquo;s last <i>spark</i> might glimmer
here;<br />
And the last words that choak&rsquo;d his parting sigh&mdash;<br

&ldquo;Oh! at your feet, dear masters, let me die!&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
